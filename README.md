 This is a coding example working on Cache 2018.1.3  
 It will not be kept in synch with new versions      
 It is also NOT serviced by InterSystems Support !   
~~~  

This is now the version compatible to IRIS unsing *IRIS Native API for Node.js*
Node / JavaScript have wide reputation to work as a WebSocket client.  
By using the IRIS adapter it becomes easy to control it and to consume the results as a   
Client for WebSocket Servers and to collect the replies in CachÃ©, Ensemble, ..   

I used node-v10.15.1-x64.msi and intersystems-iris-native package

You provide a Global for input:

     ^WsockIn="wss://echo.websocket.org/"
     ^WsockIn(0)=6
     ^WsockIn(1)="Hello"
     ^WsockIn(2)="World !"
     ^WsockIn(3)="Robert"
     ^WsockIn(4)="is waiting"
     ^WsockIn(5)="for replies"
     ^WsockIn(6)="exit"

and with this echo server you get back a Global as output

     ^WsockOut(0)=6
     ^WsockOut(1)="Hello"
     ^WsockOut(2)="World !"
     ^WsockOut(3)="Robert"
     ^WsockOut(4)="is waiting"
     ^WsockOut(5)="for replies"
     ^WsockOut(6)="exit"

the server is controlled by ^ZSocketRun from IRIS  
     -1 => stop server and exit  
	     0 => wait for action  
      1 => sent to echo server  
                	^ZSocketRun(0)= echo server => "wss://echo.websocket.org/"  

The webSocket Servis is started vom OS commandline:  

     c:\user>node WeBSockerIRIS.js
          
you can follow the progress n console output

      C:\Program Files\nodejs\cache>node WsockIris.js
